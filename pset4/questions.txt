2.  Uncompressed data from previously lossy compressed data
    will not match original file if byte by bite comparison is made.
    lossless compressed file can be restored back to original state
3.  JPEG
4.   First, the system modifies the filename’s first
    character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file
    has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
    Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters
    to the hard drive’s list of free clusters
5.  Fill every addressable
    block with ASCII NUL bytes (zeroes)
6.  It is a header file which provides set typedefs describing several
    exact-width integer types
7.  You can fill up exactly the amount of space you want in a file which is good
    for things like bitmap headers
8.  BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte
    DWORD= 32 bits = 4 bytes
    LONG = signed 32 bits = 4 bytes
    WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes
9.  Hex:    0x424d
    ASCII:  BM
10. bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file
    biSize is the number of bytes in the info header
11. For uncompressed RGB bitmaps, if biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-
    up DIB with the origin at the lower left corner. If biHeight is negative, the
    bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
12. biBitCount
13. If it can't find the file
14. Because it specifies how many elements you want to read, and we're always
    reading a struct so we only need 1 struct
15. 3
16. It moves to a specific location in a file
17. An integer constant which, when used as the 'whence' argument to the
    fseek or fseeko function, specifies that the offset provided is relative to
    the current file position.
